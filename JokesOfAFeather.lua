			The #1# is a variable that's stored in config, and is put into loc_vars.
			The {C:} is a color modifier, and uses the color "mult" for the "+#1# " part, and then the empty {} is to reset all formatting, so that Mult remains uncolored.
				There's {X:}, which sets the background, usually used for XMult.
				There's {s:}, which is scale, and multiplies the text size by the value, like 0.8
				There's one more, {V:1}, but is more advanced, and is used in Castle and Ancient Jokers. It allows for a variable to dynamically change the color. You can find an example in the Castle joker if needed.
				Multiple variables can be used in one space, as long as you separate them with a comma. {C:attention, X:chips, s:1.3} would be the yellow attention color, with a blue chips-colored background,, and 1.3 times the scale of other text.
				You can find the vanilla joker descriptions and names as well as several other things in the localization files.
