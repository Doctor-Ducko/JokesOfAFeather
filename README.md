# Jokes Of A Feather || Doctor Ducko

## A Work-in-Progress Balatro Content Mod with Semi-Decent Balance

## Overview
"Jokes of a Feather" adds a decent handful of new jokers, seals, enhancements, decks, and consumables with balance that only somewhat respects the original Balatro.

This mod is still in development and things are obviously subject to change, yadda yadda yadda
